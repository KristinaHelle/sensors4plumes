\title{
Optimisation of sensor locations by a binary genetic algorithm 
}
\description{
\code{optimiseSD_genetic} optimises sensors for a given \code{Simulations} object and \code{costFunction}. It starts from a population of sensor sets that can be provided and else are random. By testing them and recombining good locations, a new improved population is generated. This process continues until the aim or a stopping criterion is reached. It applies the binary genetic algorithm \code{\link[genalg]{rbga.bin}}.\cr
\code{numberPenalty} is the default evaluation function, it returns the penalty if \code{aimNumber} is exceeded, else the cost computed by \code{costFun}.
}
\usage{
optimiseSD_genetic(simulations, costFun, 
  locationsAll = 1:nLocations(simulations), locationsFix = integer(0), locationsInitial = integer(0),
  aimCost = NA, aimNumber = NULL,
  nameSave = NA, verbatim = FALSE,
  evalFunc = numberPenalty, 
  popSize = 200, iters = 100, 
  mutationChance = NA, elitism = NA
)
numberPenalty(chromosome, simulations, costFun, locationsAll, locationsFix, aimNumber, penalty = 2)
}

\arguments{
Some arguments are the same for all optimisation algorithms, they are marked by a \code{*}, for detail see \code{\link{optimiseSD}}. Others are directly forwarded to \code{\link[genalg]{rbga.bin}}, they are marked by \code{**}
  \item{simulations}{\code{*}}
  \item{costFun}{\code{*}}
  \item{locationsAll}{\code{*}}
  \item{locationsFix}{\code{*}}
  \item{locationsInitial}{\code{*}; here it may also be a matrix, each row indicates a set of sensors}
  \item{aimCost}{\code{*}}
  \item{aimNumber}{\code{*}; if \code{locationsInitial} given it must be \code{NULL} and is ignored, else it defines the number of sensors in the sets of the initial population}
  \item{nameSave}{\code{*}}
  \item{verbatim}{if more output is to be written to the console}
  \item{evalFunc}{\code{**}; this function has to take a chromosome and return its cost (including fix sensors); it can be modified by \code{\link{replaceDefault}} with \code{type = "evalFunc.rbga.bin"}}
  \item{popSize}{\code{**}} 
  \item{iters}{\code{**}} 
  \item{mutationChance}{\code{**}}
  \item{elitism}{\code{**}}
  \item{chromosome}{a vector of 0 and 1 of the same length as \code{locationsAll} indicating sensors at the positions of 1.}
  \item{penalty}{\code{numeric} to be returned if number of 1s in \code{chromosome} exceeds \code{aimNumber}.}
}

\details{
In general the function is used within the wrapper \code{\link{optimiseSD}}. The \code{**}-parameters are specific to \code{optimiseSD_greedy}, they may be changed beforehand via \code{\link{replaceDefault}} with \code{type = "optimisationFun.optimiseSD"}; all other parameters are forwarded from \code{optimiseSD}. 
If \code{aimCost} is given, the algorithm stops when the aim is reached by the best sampling design. In this case, nothing is returned, but the populations are saved (at \code{saveName} and if nothing indicated at \code{"opt_genetic.Rdata"}), see examples how to extract the sampling designs in this case.
