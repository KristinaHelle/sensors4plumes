# to be decided:
# a) ways to define aim as nr of sensors: aimN, length of locationsInitial?
# b) how to treat multiple/impossible initial or possible locations: delete with warning?
# c) stopping rules depend on algorithm

# a) ways to define initial
#   greedy: if not explicitly defined, use 0 sensors and add with algorithm
#   ssa: either define explicitly OR give number and use simple random (for spatially balanced random etc. define explicitly beforehand with other fun)
#   gen: rbga.bin can take several initial sampling designs (each in row of matrix) or do it randomly
#   complete: cannot take it into account, may use it to define number
## initial: can be vector or list; if list given and not gen used, only first entry is taken into account
# b) delete with warning
# c) define all parameters specific for algorithm beforehand (via replaceDefault)

# change: only use concrete default values, not names of values to be impoarted from wrapping function; for import define there what to use
